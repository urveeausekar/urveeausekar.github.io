Passwords have existed since long before the internet (“What is the secret word?”). But now, the majority of the websites on the internet use login IDs and passwords to verify a user’s identity. This suggests that we should be asking how secure passwords really are. And we are. In places where I am asked to create a password, I very commonly see guidelines that the new password needs to adhere to. This is an attempt to get users to create strong passwords - ones that will be difficult to crack.

But how effective are these guidelines? The one I take the most issue with is the minimum length of 8 characters. In general, the longer the password, the stronger it is, so it’s a good idea to have passwords that are longer than 8 characters. And having a longer password length is more important than adding complexity (like special characters) to the password. It might be harder to remember a longer password, but that’s a solvable problem - there are password managers that can remember the password for you.

This XKCD webcomic I came across [here][here] illustrates the trouble beautifully.
