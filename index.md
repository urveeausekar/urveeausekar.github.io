I’ve always loved to find out how things work - in school I would love to find out what causes weather phenomena. But as I grew older, the biggest puzzle nearby was the computer. So I chose Computer Engineering as my major for my Bachelor’s degree. During my Bachelors, I got interested in systems software, because it helped me find out what goes on under the hood, and it taught me what works in real life applications.

During an internship at a cyber security startup, I realized that security is not something that can be bolted on at the end of a project. It starts with the developer and grows with the project. That’s why I chose the Computer Security Track for my MS CS at Columbia Engineering, where I was able to explore topics at the intersection of systems software and cyber security.

My talents include quickly learning new skills, communicating with people and being patient even while solving kernel bugs, and continuing to learn new skills. So far, I’m good at programming in C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, assembly, and I have knowledge about Linux, Unix, AWS, Git and SQL. 

I love designing systems, programming and learning more about computer security, and I am currently looking for exciting opportunities which can help me continue my journey into computer science. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
