Hello! I'm Urvee. I'm very interested in computer science. I love designing systems, programming and learning more about computer security. Welcome to my personal website + blog! Most of the thoughts I share here are about computer science, but I occasionally write about other things that interest me, like books and music.

I recently graduated from Columbia Engineering, and am currently looking for exciting opportunities which can help me continue my journey into computer science. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
