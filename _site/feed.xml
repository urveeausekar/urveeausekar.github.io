Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

But now, the majority of the websites on the internet use login IDs and passwords to verify a user’s identity. This suggests that we should be asking how secure passwords really are. And we are. In places where I am asked to create a password, I very commonly see guidelines that the new password needs to adhere to. This is an attempt to get users to create strong passwords - ones that will be difficult to crack.</p>

<p>But how effective are these guidelines? The one I take the most issue with is the minimum length of 8 characters. In general, the longer the password, the stronger it is, so it’s a good idea to have passwords that are longer than 8 characters. And having a longer password length is more important than adding complexity (like special characters) to the password. It might be harder to remember a longer password, but that’s a solvable problem - there are password managers that can remember the password for you.</p>

<p>This XKCD webcomic I came across <a href="https://xkcd.com/936">here</a> illustrates the trouble beautifully.</p>
